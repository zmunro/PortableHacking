# PortableHacking
Final project on Portable Hacking devices for Comp116: Computer System Security

The comments in the hack.sh should explain everything, but if you are reading this first, there are some things to know:

1. The hack.sh file will not run as provided. Due to weird complications with how bash handles the timeout command 
    and how it is much easier to execute the commands necessary one at a time, the script is only provided as a guideline.
    
2. The variables $BSSID and $ESSID are not assigned within the script, it is upt to you to assign them with the BSSID and
    ESSID of the network you are attacking. 

3. This attack requires aircrack-ng and a secure WiFi connection.

4. This is only for educational purposes only. Some commands in hack.sh are illegal to run depending on your country.
